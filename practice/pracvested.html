    <h2>Plan B</h2>
    <p>Plan B exitsted in the mid-late 1990's. It consisted of two basses, a singer/rapper, a drummer and precussionists. We only played two "real" shows. One was a concert to raise the awareness around AIDS and HIV.  The other was a high school dance. No official recordings were ever made but at one point we played a show for our drummer's graduation from high school and his father happened to record it.</p>
